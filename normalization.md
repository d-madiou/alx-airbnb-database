# Normalization to 3NF â€“ Airbnb Clone Project

## First Normal Form (1NF)
All attributes contain atomic values. No repeating groups or arrays exist. 

## Second Normal Form (2NF)
Each table has a single primary key (UUID), and all non-key fields depend entirely on it. 

## Third Normal Form (3NF)
There are no transitive dependencies. All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key and not on any other non-key attribute. 

## Conclusion
The database schema has been reviewed and is compliant with 3NF standards. For this no changes were needed.
